## Design Principles Applied

### 1. Professional Typography
- **Font:** Inter (clean, readable, industry-standard)
- **Sizes:** Conservative scale (0.75rem to 1.875rem)
- **Weights:** Moderate (400-600, no heavy weights)
- **Spacing:** Negative letter-spacing for sophistication
- **Line heights:** Generous for readability (1.4-1.65)

### 2. Serious Color Palette
- **Primary:** Slate gray (#475569) - trustworthy, professional
- **Secondary:** Neutral grays - clean, medical-grade
- **Status:** Muted semantic colors - clear but not garish
- **Backgrounds:** Very light gray (#fafbfc) - reduced eye strain
- **Surfaces:** Pure white cards on subtle background

### 3. Generous White Space
- **Content padding:** 2.5rem (increased)
- **Card spacing:** 2rem bottom margins
- **Section separation:** Clear visual hierarchy
- **Max width:** 1600px for optimal reading

### 4. Minimal Animations
- **Removed:** All decorative animations
- **Kept:** Only essential loading states
- **Transitions:** Fast (0.1-0.15s) for efficiency
- **Philosophy:** This is not social media

### 5. Best Design Practices
- **Flat design:** No gradients or heavy shadows
- **Clear hierarchy:** Through spacing and typography
- **High contrast:** For accessibility
- **Consistent patterns:** All components follow same rules
